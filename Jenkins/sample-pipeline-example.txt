Step-1: Launch EC2 instance RHEL and connect to it.

		1.1. Login to AWS
		1.2. Go to EC2 service
		1.3. Launch instance
		1.4. Connect to the instance once its status is running

Step-2: Install jenkins, java, git, maven, tomcat etc on EC2 RHEL instance.

		Reference URL: https://github.com/DevOpsPlatform/Phase-1/blob/master/Java-Tomcat-maven-git-Jenkins.sh

		Follow the Installation Procedure to setup Jenkins
		
		Manual steps: updated the tomcat users file with a new users
		started the tomcat server
		launch the URL in any browser: http://54.172.37.2:8080

		Jenkins setup completed.

Step-3: Create Jenkins job with Github project URL.

		You can configure your own github priject repo url or you can fork this repo, so that it will add to your account.
		
		https://github.com/venkatasykam/DevOpsWebApp.git
		
		Run the job Manually.
		Job name: DevOpsWebApp-CI/

Step-4: Integrate Jenkins and GitHub.

		Job name: DevOpsWebApp-CI/

		Now let's integrate jenkins & github to run the jenkins job automatically for every code change i.e., git push

		From Github:
		repo settings --> Webhooks --> Add a new hook or edit the existing to change the Jenkins server details.

		From Jenkins job:
		job config --> build triggers section --> poll scm --> */1 * * * *

		Now, clone the code and do git push or do commit in git web.
		
		Build#2 --> Started by an SCM change
		Build#1 --> Started by user devops
		
		From this we can understand, that for every git push, jenkins job is running automatically.

		Clone the repo to anywhere in your machine
		I am cloning a specific branch 'web'
		
		Build#3 --> Started by an SCM change

		Auto trigger the Jenkins job for every git push (code check-in) is working.

		Let's do the same this with jenkins pipeline script
		
		Refer: https://github.com/venkatasykam/DevOpsWebApp/blob/web/Jenkinsfile
		
		Pipeline job also running automatically for every commit, usually we don't configure like auto trigger the pipeline job which has some stages like code checkout, deploy to server etc. For every commit we dont't need to deploy the package to nexus/tomcat.
